# TileDB-Py 0.6.6 Release Notes

**Note that we will be removing wheel support for macOS 10.9-10.12 in TileDB-Py 0.7 (planned for release in August 2020).** This change is due to upstream (AWS SDK) minimum version requirements. The minimum supported version for macOS wheels on PyPI will be macOS 10.13.

**Note that we will be removing support for [manylinux1](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/tree/manylinux1) wheels in TileDB-Py 0.7 (planned for release in August 2020).** manylinux1 is based on CentOS5, which has been unsupported for several years.

TileDB-Py 0.7 release.

- raise an error when trying to consolidate an open readonly array [#172](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/172)

# TileDB-Py 0.4.2 Release Notes

TileDB-Py 0.4.2 contains several improvements as well as bug-fixes associated with the TileDB 1.5.1 release.

## New features

- support for NumPy complex types ([#142](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/142))

## Bug fixes
- fixed query buffer memory leak ([#151](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/151))
- fixed segfault during consolidation ([TileDB #1213](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1213))
   - *note: to receive this fix, conda and source builds should be updated to TileDB 1.5.1. TileDB-Py 0.4.2 binaries on PyPI bundle the updated TileDB 1.5.1 library.*
- fixed indexing with array dtype different from the platform default ([#146](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/146))
- fixed `VFS.is_bucket` when VFS is initialized with a Ctx object ([#148](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/148))
- fixed `schema_like` to correctly forward a Ctx keyword arg ([#148](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/148))

# TileDB-Py 0.4.1 Release Notes

## New Features:

* several high-level API additions (tiledb.open, .save, .empty_like, .schema_like), and serialization improvements including pickling support for DenseArray objects (#129)
* manylinux1 wheels for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 are available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/tiledb

# TileDB-Py 0.4.0 Release Notes

This release builds TileDB-Py against TileDB 1.5

## New Features:

* support for variable-length arrays (#120)

## Breaking changes:

* the Ctx argument is now a keyword argument, simplifying API use in the common case (#122)

  for example: `tiledb.DenseArray(ctx, uri, ...)` becomes: tiledb.DenseArray(uri, ...)
  or optionally `tiledb.DenseArray(uri, ..., ctx=ctx)`
