# TileDB-Py 0.7.0 Release Notes

## TileDB Embedded updates:
* TileDB-Py 0.7.0 includes [TileDB Embedded 2.1.2](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/releases/tag/2.1.2)
  featuring a number of significant improvements, with major highlights including:
  - no longer uses Intel TBB for parallelization by default. Along with many benefits to TileDB Embedded, this
    significantly reduces complications and bugs with python multiprocessing fork mode.
  - Support coalescing subarray ranges to give major performance boosts.

## Packaging Notes
* TileDB-Py 0.7 packages on PyPI support macOS 10.13+ and manylinux10-compatible Linux distributions only.
  For now, wheels could be produced supporting older systems but without Google Cloud Support; if needed,
  please contact us to discuss.

## Improvements
* Added ".df[]" indexer tiledb.Array: directly returns a Pandas dataframe from a query (uses `multi_index` indexing behavior) [#390](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/389)
* Added parallel CSV ingestion example using Python multiprocessing with `tiledb.from_csv` [#397](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/397)
* Added wrapping and support for TileDB checksumming filters: `ChecksumMD5Filter` and `ChecksumSHA256Filter` [#389](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/389)
* Removed TBB install from default setup.py, corresponding to TileDB Embedded changes [#389](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/389)
* Add support for 'capacity' kwarg to `from_csv`/`from_pandas` [#391](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/391)
* Add support for 'tile' kwarg to `from_csv`/`from_pandas` to customize Dim tile extent [#391](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/391)
* Added '--release-symbols' option for building in release optimization with debug symbols [#402](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/402)
* Changed `allows_duplicates` default to `True` for `from_csv/from_pandas` [#394](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/394)

## Bug fixes
* Fixed bug indexing anonymous attributes of sparse arrays using `A[]` (did not affect dense or multi_index) [#404](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/404)
* Fixed rendering of column name in mixed dtype exception [#382](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/382)
* Fixed forwarding of 'ctx' kwarg to from_csv/from_pandas [#383](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/383)
* Fixed type of return values for empty results when indexing a sparse array [#384](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/384)

## Misc Updates
* Added round-trip tests for all filter `repr` objects [#389](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Py/pull/389)

# TileDB-Py 0.6.6 Release Notes

**Note that we will be removing wheel support for macOS 10.9-10.12 in TileDB-Py 0.7 (planned for release in August 2020).** This change is due to upstream (AWS SDK) minimum version requirements. The minimum supported version for macOS wheels on PyPI will be macOS 10.13.

**Note that we will be removing support for [manylinux1](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/tree/manylinux1) wheels in TileDB-Py 0.7 (planned for release in August 2020).** manylinux1 is based on CentOS5, which has been unsupported for several years. We now provide wheels built with [manylinux2010](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/), which is based on CentOS6 / glibc 2.12.

We have added manylinux2010 wheels, corresponding to CentOS6 / glibc 2.12.

We are deprecating support for manylinux1 (CentOS5 / glibc 2.0.7), which is not supported by
the Google Cloud Storage SDK. We are planning to remove manylinux1 wheel support in the
TileDB-Py 0.7 release.
