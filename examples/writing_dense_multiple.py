# DESCRIPTION
#
# Please see the TileDB documentation for more information:
#   https://docs.tiledb.com/main/solutions/tiledb-embedded/api-usage/writing-arrays/writing-in-dense-subarrays
#
# When run, this program will create a simple 2D dense array, write some data
# to it with two write queries, and read the entire array data back.
